# NvidiaNIMmultiRAG  

This project implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **Nvidia's NeMo Inference Microservices (NIM)** to enhance AI-powered search and response generation.  

ðŸš€ The application is currently live and can be accessed [here](https://nvidianimmultirag-lnhephhb7y8fsf55by53nr.streamlit.app/).  

## Project Overview  

This project integrates Nvidia's NIM models with a **multi-document RAG pipeline**, allowing efficient information retrieval and improved response generation. It is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend and leverages Nvidia's NeMo for backend processing.  

### Key Features  
- **Multi-document retrieval** using RAG to generate informed responses.  
- **Nvidia NeMo Inference** for scalable and efficient AI-driven retrieval.  
- **Streamlit-based UI** for easy interaction and exploration.  
- **Custom datasets** integrated for testing and validation.  

### Project Structure  
- `finalapp.py` â€“ Main Streamlit application integrating RAG and NeMo models.  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Dependencies for setting up the project.  
- `us_census/` â€“ Sample dataset used for retrieval and testing.  

### Running the Project Locally  
To run this project locally, clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```sh
